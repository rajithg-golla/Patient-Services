        This component abstracts out the modal functionality of lightning:overlayLibrary with a
        simple, two method, API; open and close. This allows any component to be treated as a modal
        without modification or handling any modal-related events. Once placed within the containing
        component, a modal may be opened by calling its open method with three parameters:
        - Modal header / title
        - The fully qualified name of the component to be hosted
        - Any parameters to pass to the hosted component (including aura:id if desired)
        Note: The hosted component must be completely self-contained as there is no communication
        between the modal wrapper and the component being hosted.

        The close method simply closes the modal via the overlay libraryâ€™s notifyClose method. Given
        this, the modal may also be closed by calling the library function directly within your code.
